This post contains useful links for the students to learn the basics of research, preparing presentation, and writing scientific paper/report.


Usually my summer students need to prepare a poster at the end of the program. Although they have a training as part of the summer program at ORNL I also recommend them to read these resources:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">  
<li> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/how-prepare-scientific-poster"> How to prepare a scientific poster</a>  </li>
<li> <a href="https://guides.nyu.edu/posters">How to create a research poster</a>  </li>
</ul>

Another output for my summer students is to write a scientific report. These are a few articles that are quite a useful resource.
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">  
<li> <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/writingcentre/ua/media/28/learningguide-writingaresearchreport.pdf"> Writing a research report</a>  </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/how-to-write-a-research-paper/">The ultimate guide to writing a research paper</a>  </li>
</ul>

If some of the students want to continue towards the career of science and research, I recommend the following resources to learn more about scientific research in general.

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">  
<li> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5019873/">What is scientific research and how can it be done?</a>  </li>
<li> <a href="https://john.cs.olemiss.edu/~hcc/researchMethods/2014spr/notes/localcopy/cs_method.pdf">Scientific methods in computer science</a>  </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-002"> A manifesto for reproducible science </a>  </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3383002/?ref=data-school">Reproducible research in computational science</a>  </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1715374115">Transparency in authors contributions and responsibilities to promote integrity in scientific publication</a>  </li>
</ul>
